        MAGIC Data Mining (2020)
      </h1>
      <p>
        <span class="fieldname"> Description: </span> I collaborated with a partner to create and compare two models that classify the MAGIC Gamma Telescope (MAGIC) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
        The telescope records partical showers which are caused by high-energy gamma rays or by hadron rays.  The goal is to classify the telescope's representation of the shower as either gamma or hadron caused.
        We first visualized our data to look for correlating variables and the underlying distributions of our variables.  
        We then preprocessed the data including normalizing attributes and splitting the data into a test set and training set.
        We chose to build a Naive Bayes model as our baseline, and then went on to use a Support Vector Machine.
        Model performance was evaluated using the area under the ROC curve.
        The dataset is <br> <br>
        
        <span class="fieldname"> Interesting results or findings: </span>  The Naive Bayes model had an area under the ROC curve of 0.78 (with 1 being a perfect classification).
        The Support Vector Machine model had an area under the ROC curve of 0.92.  
        We believe that the SVM was the better model in this case because Naive Bayes assumes that variables are independent, whereas our dataset showed some correlated variables.
        SVM on the otherhand does not assume independence adn works well in high dimensions. <br> <br>
        
        <span class="fieldname"> Challenges: </span> One point of confusion was that more advanced pre-processing methods seemed to decrease performance.  
        We are still not entirely sure why this would be, but it may show that sometimes manipulating the data too much may interfere with the model's ability to work with the data. <br> <br>

        AI Checkers (2019)
      </h1>
      <p>
        <span class="fieldname">  Description: </span> I created an AI to play Checkers against a human opponent using state space search and the heuristic minimax algorithm.
        The game is printed in the console where the human player makes a move by typing the start and ending locations of a piece. The new board is printed after each move.
        The program keeps track of the state of the game including the location of each piece, which player each piece belongs to, which pieces are kings and pawns, and which player's turn it is.
        The AI checks all possible actions and makes a queue of possible states resulting from these actions.  It checks if the current state is a terminal state and checks the utility of the terminal state.
        It then uses the heuristic minimax algorithm with a cutoff to determine the move the yields the highest utility. (if draw: utility = 0, if computer wins utility = 1, if human wins, utility = -1)
        The heuristic involves a weighted difference of the computer's pieces eand the person's pieces.
        The game runs until someone wins or there is a tie.  I'm not particularly good at checkers, but the AI never loses. <br> <br>
        
        <span class="fieldname"> Interesting results or findings: </span> There weren't necessarily interesting "results" for this project, but it was enjoyable and gratifying.  
        The only points I lost for this assignment were because I thought checkers had two rows of pawns when it in fact has three. <br> <br>
        
        <span class="fieldname">  Challenges: </span> The most difficult part of this project was checking for all possible actions.  For the assignment, a chip must make the longest possible series of captures available.
        When searching for possible moves, I had to keep track of the longest series of captures and clear the queue if I found one that was longer.  Checking all the possible moves took
        required me to very abstractly conceptualize the board and to think through all possible scenarios.<br> <br>

        Summer 2021 Internship: Topic Modeling of Energy Storage Literature
      </h1>
      <p>
        <span class="fieldname"> Description: </span> This summer, I will be doing a data science internship with the Department of Energy under the Mickey Leland Energy Fellowship.
        The objective is to create a useful tool for exploring scientific literature on renewable energy storage.
        I will be working with unsupervised natural language processing algorithms to extract paper topics and group them.
        Then I will work on building a website for visualizing the results that harness the human visual system to make it easier to see research trends and locate interesting or relevant papers.
        Ideally, the tool we create can be generalized to other scientific fields.
        Check back in August for more updates, or look at the project website below! <br> <br>
