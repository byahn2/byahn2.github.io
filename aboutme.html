        About Me <br>
      </h1>
      <p>
        <br>I value community, creativity, and self-improvement, and I try to design my life to reflect these values.<br>
        I've learned that when I find a balance between different areas of my life, it helps me to thrive in all areas, so I'm very intentional about making time for the things that matter to me.

          <span class="fieldname"> STEM Initiative: </span> 
          One thing I'm passionate about is making STEM fields a more welcoming and friendly environment for women and minority groups.
          I found an opportunity to work towards this cause by volunteering with the University of Rochester's STEM Initiative Club.
          Every week, we went to a local elementary school and presented a STEM topic with a fun, interactive experiment.
          The goal is to get kids excited about STEM at a young age, and to inspire them to believe in their own capabilities.<br><br>
          
          I care a lot about this club, and served as secretary for two terms.
          As secretary, I coordinated the volunteer events and managed volunteer sign-ups as well as experiment resources.
          I also coordinated Family Science Day, one of the largest collaborative events on campus.
          Over 30 clubs and organizations on campus set up a table with a fun science experiment, 
          and we invite members of the community to bring their kids for a full day of science fun. <br><br>
          
          Sadly, due to COVID, I wasn't able to participate for my last year of college.<br><br>

        <p>
          <span class="fieldname"> It's On Us: </span> 
          Another issue I'm passionate about is making college campuses a safe space for all women.
          I joined It's On Us: a student board aimed at raising awareness and changing policy related to campus sexual violence.
          I served as the Social Media manager, and I was responsible for raising awareness on online platforms as well as advertising events.
          Each semester, I put together a spreadsheet of what I would post on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.          
          Each month had a theme, and each week, I would post articles, activities, and food for thought related to the theme of the month.
          While I'm no longer a part of the club, it's purpose still aligns strongly with my interests, 
          and I hope to help make my workplace inclusive and welcoming whereever I go.<br><br>

          <span class="fieldname"> Boys and Girls Club of Rochester: </span> 
          STEM Initiative worked closely with the Boys and Girls Club of Rochester.  
          Through STEM initative, I learned about the club and the services it provides for the community.
          I occasionally volunteer there, helping the kids with arts and crafts projects and generally hanging out with and supervising them
          I also donate to them regularly and support what they do for the Rochester Community.

          <span class="fieldname"> Take 5 Program: </span> 
          My junior year of college, I was awarded a Take 5 scholarship that gave me free tuition for a fifth year of college.
          The scholarship allowed me to take 8 additional classes relating to a topic I was passionate about, but didn't have time to pursue due to my major coursework.
          I chose to explore how photography affects and manipulates our perception of the world.
          Through this scholarship, I took photography, art history, philosophy, and even poetry courses.<br><br>
          
          One of my favorite classes was Arts and Activism where I explored how art can reframe political events and influence public opinion and social justice movements.  
          We were able to do a photovoice project where we collected photographs and interviews from people in the Rochester community and displayed them in a Rochester wide event called The Reckoning that encouraged people to vote in their 2020 election.<br><br>
          
          I also took multiple studio art photography courses including an independent study which served as the capstone for my project.
          Capstones usually end with a gallery of the project, but due to COVID, that wasn't possible.
          Because of this, I decided to create an interactive website that could be shared with people as part of the project.
          I learned how to code in HTML in order to create this project, and subsequently decided to make this personal website.<br><br>

          <span class="fieldname"> Rock Climbing: </span> 
          I get a lot of enjoyment out of challenging myself to try new things and working towards new goals.
          My junior year of college, a friend introduced me to rock climbing, and I was immediately hooked.
          There's something so gratifying about getting to the top of a route that you've really struggled on and worked for.
          I love working on routes outside my comfort zone, overcoming my fears, and watching myself become a stronger, better climber.
