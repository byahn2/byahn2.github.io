        AI Checkers (2019)
      </h1>
      <p>
        <span class="fieldname">  Description: </span> For this project, I created an AI to play Checkers against a human opponent using state space search and the heuristic minimax algorithm.
        The game is printed in the console where the human player makes a move by typing the start and ending locations of a piece. The new board is printed after each move.
        The program keeps track of the state of the game including the location of each piece, which player each piece belongs to, which pieces are kings and pawns, and which player's turn it is.
        The AI checks all possible actions and makes a queue of possible states resulting from these actions.  It checks if the current state is a terminal state and checks the utility of the terminal state.
        It then uses the heuristic minimax algorithm with a cutoff to determine the move the yields the highest utility. (if draw: utility = 0, if computer wins utility = 1, if human wins, utility = -1)
        The heuristic involves a weighted difference of the computer's pieces eand the person's pieces.
        The game runs until someone wins or there is a tie.  I'm not particularly good at checkers, but the AI never loses. <br> <br>
        
        <span class="fieldname"> Interesting results or findings: </span> There weren't necessarily interesting "results" for this project, but it was enjoyable and gratifying.  
        The only points I lost for this assignment were because I thought checkers had two rows of pawns when it in fact has three. <br> <br>
        
        <span class="fieldname">  Challenges: </span> The most difficult part of this project was checking for all possible actions.  For the assignment, a chip must make the longest possible series of captures available.
        When searching for possible moves, I had to keep track of the longest series of captures and clear the queue if I found one that was longer.  Checking all the possible moves took
        required me to very abstractly conceptualize the board and to think through all possible scenarios.<br> <br>

        Summer 2021 Internship: Topic Modeling of Energy Storage Literature
      </h1>
      <p>
        <span class="fieldname"> Description: </span> This summer, I will be doing a data science internship with the Department of Energy under the Mickey Leland Energy Fellowship.
        The objective is to create a useful tool for exploring scientific literature on renewable energy storage.
        I will be working with unsupervised natural language processing algorithms to extract paper topics and group them.
        Then I will work on building a website for visualizing the results that harness the human visual system to make it easier to see research trends and locate interesting or relevant papers.
        Ideally, the tool we create can be generalized to other scientific fields.
        Check back in August for more updates, or look at the project website below! <br> <br>
